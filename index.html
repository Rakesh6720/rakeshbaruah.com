        <p class="work-meta">Full-length play</p>
        <p>Tyrant is a full-length drama about the seduction of relevance in the streaming era. After being pushed to the margins of a changing media landscape, a prominent anchor trades credibility for virality and is gradually consumed by the system he helped build. The play examines how institutions reward certainty, punish doubt, and reshape the people inside them.</p>
